# NOTE:
# The source contains another part about LFS, but while it reduces the size of the repo somewhat,
# Github offers it only with limits and charges for it after 1GB.
# Strangely, using binary does not include any restriction, despite having to keep
# a copy of the data for every change. So we handle the pictures as binary for now.
#
# Interesting commands:
# - git add --renormalize .
#   - applies all changes
# - git ls-files --eol
#   - shows line endings and infos per file

# Set default behaviour to automatically normalize line endings.
# EDIT: But we enforce "lf", since this was the setting before.

# Force batch scripts to always use CRLF line endings so that if a repo is accessed
# in Windows via a file share from Linux, the scripts will work.
*.{cmd,[cC][mM][dD]} text eol=crlf

# Force bash scripts to always use LF line endings so that if a repo is accessed
